> #### Data Focus
>
> Modules and Handouts 2--6 cover topics that are part of the data analysis journey and are all interrelated. Each module will introduce new content and expand on the material covered in previous modules. For example, in Module 2 we introduce the basics of the R plotting systems. Subsequent handouts include more advanced plotting options and techniques.

## Tabular Data

In this module we begin to work with complete tables of data, and learn how to make informative graphs. 

We will start by getting our scientific research data into RStudio. Commonly, we first enter our data into Excel for cleaning and organising, and save it out as a csv (comma separated values) file. We then import the file into R for data analysis. We will provide the csv file to be used with this module.

When you have completed this module, you should be ready to produce the graphs and figures you will need for your in-course research projects. If you run into any problems or have any questions, email us, or drop us a message in the R4SSP class team on MS Teams.


## Preparation - Do this very carefully

Document organisation is vitally important. We suggest that you keep a separate folder for each R4SSP module. To do this, you can set up a formal RStudio project (see for example https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects). But if you don't feel quite ready for that, you can just collect your script file and data files together in a folder. Proceed as follows:


1. Launch R Studio

2. Following the procedure from **Using a Script File** in Module 1 - Intro to R and RStudio, create a script file and save it to your desktop or other location where you will be able to find it.

3. Quit R Studio

4. Locate the script file you just made (it will have a .R file suffix). 

5. Create a new folder (name it something sensible) and place the script file in it.

6. The sample csv data file used in this module is called **gapminder_data_2007.csv**. This file contains life expectancy, population and GDP values for 142 different countries. The data for each country were measured 12 times between 1952 and 2007. These data are sourced from the GapMinder foundation (https://www.gapminder.org/).

Retrieve the sample csv data file from the course Google Drive shared folder ^[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ttf1s8-vkJNOlHdphfi2zFyMq6gGEvCy?usp=sharing]. Place the csv file into the folder with your script file.

7. Open the folder and double-click **on your script file** to open it in RStudio.

If you set things up this way, RStudio will be able to find your data file for the next step -- importing data.

\

## Importing a data file

The first few lines of our data file **gapminder_data_2007.csv** as it appears when opened in Excel, are shown below:

```{r fig01, fig.align='center', out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "GapMinder Data", fig.pos = "H", echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("images/gapminder_data_2007.png")
```



We will import this file into R for some preliminary data analysis.

To import a csv file into R we can use the function `read.csv`. Like the R functions we used in Module 1, `read.csv` accepts an argument between its round brackets. The argument is the name of the input file. Because the name of the file is a string, we surround it with double quotes. We will therefore say:

`read.csv("gapminder_data_2007.csv")`

\

## Import and check your data

Type the following line into your script file. Execute the command as you did in the previous module by placing the cursor anywhere on the line and typing ctrl-Enter (Windows) or cmd-Enter (Mac).

```{r read.csv}
read.csv("gapminder_data_2007.csv")
```


When imported into R, the data from the csv file are stored in an R object called a **data frame**.Data frames are simply tables, organised into rows and columns. The columns have names taken from the first row of the csv file, and each subsequent row of the csv file becomes a row in the data frame. 

When you call `read.csv`, passing in a file name, R reads in the file, converts it to a data frame, and displays it in the console. The columns have the same names as in the csv file. We will see later that we can use the column names to explore specific properties of our data set.

Our call to function `read.csv` will import the file and display its contents in the console, but this is not quite enough. We want R to store the data in a named variable so that we can refer to it later (i.e., perform analyses on it). We do that with the assignment operator, as we did in our previous module. For example, we can say:

```{r import into variable}

# Save an imported data frame into a named variable
gapminder_data <- read.csv("gapminder_data_2007.csv")

```

After storing our imported data into a variable, you should always check that your data have been imported correctly. Data entry errors can cause R to make the wrong assumptions about your data. If you have a column of numbers that contains even one accidental alphabetic character (typos do happen) R will consider the whole column to be strings. Later, R will give the wrong results when you perform statistical analyses on these data (or it will refuse to perform them at all). 

Use the following commands to visually inspect your imported data:

```{r check 1}
# Write the first few lines of a data frame to the console with function head
head(gapminder_data)


# Write the last few lines of a data frame to the console with function tail
tail(gapminder_data)
```

```{r check 2}
# Display the number of lines, the column names, and the data type of each 
# column, with function str
str(gapminder_data)
```

Each column header is associated with a data type **chr**, **int**, or **num**. These indicate what kind of data R identified in the input file. Columns that are **chr** contain strings (characters), columns that are **int** contain integers (whole numbers) and columns that are num contain numbers with a decimal part. 

You can see the same information about the structure of a data frame in the Environment panel of RStudio (upper-right of screen; Environment tab). When you successfully import a csv into a variable with `read.csv`, the resulting data frame appears in the Environment pane. Click the blue arrow beside the object to display the details of its structure.

```{r fig02, fig.align='center', out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "Data Frame in Environment Pane", fig.pos = "H", echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("images/df_in_env_pane.PNG")
```

\


## Selecting and using columns of data

In both of the above displays, each column name is prefaced with `$`. We can use the `$` operator to select individual columns of data from a data frame. For example, to select just the life expectancy values from our data, we say `gapminder_data$lifeExp`. (Be sure to type the column name exactly as it appears in the output of `str` and in the Environment pane.) We can use this directly as the argument to a function, or we can store the selected column in a variable (which will be a vector) for later processing. 

For example:

``` {r single column examples}

# Print the first few values of column year
head(gapminder_data$year)


# Store column continent in a new variable
continents <- gapminder$continent

# Pass the variable to function levels which returns the values
# of a categorical variable
levels(continents)

```

## Creating graphs in R

There are a variety of complex analyses that we can perform on a data frame using R's built-in statistical functions and those available in additional packages and libraries. We will explore many of these techniques in later modules. However, an effective first step in getting to know a data set is to generate plots and graphs to represent visually the patterns in the data.


### Simple plots - the histogram

A histogram shows the **frequency distribution** of a data set. That is, it shows counts of the  different values of the dependent variable (or ranges of values, for continuous variables). We generate this graph with function `hist`. The graph will be displayed in the Plots tab of RStudio's lower-right pane.

```{r 02-hist}
# Histogram of life expectancy values from gapminder
hist(gapminder_data$lifeExp)
```

We see that life expectancy is approximately bell-shaped, with many scores between 65 and 85, with a small number of extreme values greater than 80 or less than 30. 


### Boxplots
The boxplot allows us to compare distribution information between groups. For example, we can compare life expectancy for the different continents. 

The R function `boxplot` accepts two arguments. 

The first argument is the **formula**. This is a complex, yet very common, argument format for R statistical functions. The formula describes a linear model for a data set with the general structure: **dependent or predicted variable ~ independent variables or predictors**, using columns names from the data frame. The ~ (tilde) is read as "depends on" or "is predicted by". For our example, we are interested in the way that life expectancy is dependent on the continent, so we specify our formula as **lifeExp ~ continent**.  We will see more complex examples of the formula argument later in the semester.

The second argument to boxplot is the data frame.

```{r 02-boxplot01}
boxplot(lifeExp ~ continent, gapminder_data)
```

Boxplots efficiently illustrate both the central tendency and the variability of a data set. Each grey box extends from the first quartile to the third quartile of its input values. The dark line across the box is at the median. The two thin lines outside the qrey box show the values of the minimum and maximum scores, excluding extreme outliers. If extreme outliers are present, they are shown as small circles. This figure clearly illustrates that, in the gapminder data, life expectancy -- both central tendency and variablity -- is not the same for all continents.


### Plotting with ggplot2

The `hist` and `boxplot` functions are part of Base R. They are useful, but for more elaborate, publication-quality graphs, we can use the third-party library **ggplot** contained in package **ggplot2**. ggplot is a very popular data visualisation package based on a very elaborate symbolic system called the 'Grammar of Graphics'. 

The syntax of ggplot is complex, and we will concentrate on the foundations in this module. For additional detail, see the Data Visualisation chapter in the R for Data Science online text, at  https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html.


## Semantics of ggplot
You can think of a ggplot graph as bring built as a sequence of layers. On the bottom is the base of the graph, with axes, then the data are layered on, then titles and notations and other features. A ggplot command reflects this layered structure.

# Building a graph

To use the ggplot library, we must install the ggplot2 package (once on a computer) and invoke the library command (for every RStudio session).

```{r install and load, eval = FALSE}

# Once on any computer
install.packages(ggplot2)

# Once for any RStudio session
library(ggplot2)
```

Every graph must represent a data frame. The base part of any ggplot command is a call to function `ggplot()` passing in the data frame assigned to function argument `data`.

```{r ggplot base}

# The ggplot base layer
ggplot(data = gapminder_data)

```

If you run this command from the RStudio console or an R script in Rstudio, the grey square shown above appears in the Plots pane. This indicates that ggplot is ready to draw a figure -- this is the  bottom layer of a ggplot graph.

To add x and y axes to the graph, we need to define the relationship between an informational element in the data set and a visual element (the axes) in our graph. In ggplot this relationship is a **mapping**. To initialise a mapping, we identify a particular element of the graph (e.g. the x-axis) and assign a particular element of the data (e.g. a column in the data frame) to it. This assignment is called an **aesthetic** in the Grammar of Graphics, and in ggplot we use function `aes()` to specify aesthetics. 

Imagine that we wish to make a graph showing the relationship between per capita GDP and life expectancy (two columns in gapminder_data). We map the first variable to the x axis (argument x) of our graph and the second to the y axis (argument y). This will add a new layer. We add this information part of the command to the ggplot() base call. Note that we don't need to use the `$` operator here, as all column names in a ggplot command apply to the supplied data frame.

```{r mapping x and y}

ggplot(data = gapminder_data, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp ))


```

We have added a new layer to our graph with axes and grid lines. Note that the axes' tic values are correctly formatted for the associated data and the data frame column names are use as the axis labels (we will see how to format those labels later).

To add points to our graph, we specify a **geometry** (another term from the Grammar of Graphics). There are many, many available geometries in ggplot, corresponding to all the different sorts of graphs -- scatterplots, bar plots, pir charts, line graphs, etc. -- that you might wish to make. For our current graph, we wish to place a point at the intersection of per capita GDP (our x axis) and life expectancy (out y axis) for each row in the input data frame. To add this geometry to ggplot append `geom_point()` to your current ggplot command using the `+` operator. It is conventional to place each chunk of the ggplot command on its own line in the code.

```{r geom point}
ggplot(data = gapminder_data, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp )) +
  geom_point()
```
This figure This type of graph (usually called a **scatterplot**) illustrates the relationship between two dependent variables. Even from this very simple figure we can see that there is a *general tendency* for higher per capita GDP to be associated with higher life expectancy.




We'll now recreate the same plots as we did with the Base R plotting system.

# PH Not appropriate for this type of data set

#### Scatter plots

Here you'll see we've defined our data, we've mapped specific columns to our axes, and are using a 'point' as our geometric representation.

```{r 02-gg_point1}
ggplot(data = puppy_donations_data, mapping = aes(x = CollectorID, y = Amount)) + 
  geom_point()
```

We can also store our plots in a variable to build upon

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = puppy_donations_data, mapping = aes(x = CollectorID, y = Amount))
```

What does `p` actually contain?
```{r 02-gg}
p
```


```{r 02-gg_point2}
p + geom_point()
```


##### Specifiying colour

Remember `p` contains our initial specification of the data and mappings

```{r 02-gg_point3}
p + geom_point(colour = 'red')
```

##### Mapping colour from our data

```{r 02-gg_point4}
p + geom_point(aes(colour = Condition))
```
Notice that we didn't specify the colour for our points, instead we have told ggplot to use colours based on the values that were found in the "Condition" column using `aes`.

\

#### Line plots

In this case, we have the same data and mapping, but we want to have the data represented by a line so we choose `geom_line` as our "geom".

```{r 02-gg_line1}
p + geom_line()
```




##### Adding layers

```{r 02-gg_line2}
p + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point()
```



```{r 02-gg_line3}
p + 
  geom_line(colour = 'gold') + 
  geom_point(colour = 'tomato')
```

##### Using mappings

If you would like to plot individual lines based on a categorical variable you can used a 'group' mapping:

```{r 02-gg_line4}
p + 
  geom_line(aes(group = Condition))
```


We can specify separate aesthestics for each layer

```{r 02-gg_line5}
p + 
  geom_line(aes(colour = Condition)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = Condition))
```

Note that colour will automatically imply a _group_.

or if it is common to all layers, we can specify them in the initial setting up:

```{r 02-gg_line6}
ggplot(data = puppy_donations_data, 
       mapping = aes(x = CollectorNumber, 
                     y = Amount, 
                     colour = Condition)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point()
```

\

#### Histogram

A histogram is created from a single continuous variable.

```{r 02-gg_hist}
ggplot(data = puppy_donations_data, aes(x = Amount)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```

\

#### Boxplot

In ggplot, to create a boxplot, we need to specify a continuous variable, and a categorical variable.

```{r 02-gg_box1}
ggplot(data = puppy_donations_data, aes(x = Condition, y = Amount)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

Or you could make it horizontal by switching the the x/y arguments.

```{r 02-gg_box2}
ggplot(data = puppy_donations_data, aes(x = Amount, y = Condition)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

\

### Customising

There are a multitude of customisations that can be done to plots such as titles, labels, colours, etc.

A fantastic resource for looking at how to customise your plots made using the Base R plotting system is the [R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org).

#### Themes

For ggplot, the plots are made up of _elements_ and can be customised using `theme()` or by picking one of the pre-defined themes - e.g. `theme_bw()` provides a black/white theme.

The main elements are

- `element_text` for text
- `element_rect` for rectangular areas
- `element_line` for lines
- `element_blank` to remove/hide elements

```{r 02-gg_theme1}
ggplot(data = puppy_donations_data, aes(x = Condition, y = Amount)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 16), 
        panel.grid = element_blank(), 
        panel.background = element_rect(colour = "blue", fill = "light green"))

```



```{r 02-gg_theme2}
ggplot(data = puppy_donations_data, aes(x = Condition, y = Amount)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  theme_bw()
```

There is also a fantastic cheat sheet available in RStudio under `Help` -> `Cheat Sheats` -> `Data Visualization with ggplot2`

## Conclusion

This document has presented a simple introduction to working with complete tables of data in R. We learned how to import a csv file into a data frame, how to select columns and rows of interest from the data frame, and how to perform simple, yet illustrative summaries on them. We have covered only a tiny fraction of the data analyses you can perform with R and RStudio. You can also do very complex statistics like ANOVA, regression, factor analysis, and complex modelling. The specific statistical analyses you will need to do for your in-course assignments will depend on the papers you are taking, but you can be confident that whatever your lecturers require can almost certainly by done efficiently in R. As we proceed through the semester, if you wish to discuss a particular data analysis, processing, or presentation task, please let us know.

## Appendix

### Manual Data Entry in R

For extremely small data sets, you can manually enter tabular data into R. You create a vector for each data column using the combine function `c`, and then collect those vectors into a data frame:

```{r manual data 1}
countries <- c("Austria", "Brazil", "Canada")
capitals <- c("Vienna", "Brasilia", "Ottawa")
population_in_millions <- c(9, 211, 38)

geography_df <- data.frame(Country = countries,
                           Capital = capitals,
                           PopulationMillions = population_in_millions)

geography_df
```


### Installing Packages

When R is installed, it comes with a large set of commands, data structure, and functions which are together known as **base R**. Over the years, researchers and programmer have written thousands of additional functions and modules (called **libraries**) that you can use in your own R code. This **third-party code** is checked by moderators and, if it passes inspection, loaded onto an official R server in a file structure called a **package**. To use packages, you must first download them to your computer. They are placed in the same folders where base R was originally installed. 

To access the functions in a package in your R code, you load the package using the `library` command, as we saw above with **readr**. You only need to download a package one time on any machine, but the `library` command must be executed at the start of each RStudio session (i.e. every time you launch RStudio).

To install a package, use the `install.packages` command passing the name of the package as the function argument. The name is a string **so must be surrounded by double quotes**. To use an installed package, use the `library` command, passing in the name of the package. Now that the package has been installed, R recognises it as an entity (like a variable) so you do not put double quotes around the package name in the library command.

For example, when you want to use function `read_csv`, contained in library **readr**:

```{r getting readr, eval = FALSE}

# Download the reshape2 code to your machine
install.packages("readr")


# Load the library for the current session
library(readr)
```

### Tidyverse

The tidyverse is a collection of packages (metapackage) that are an (opinionated) way of performing analysis in R and are all designed to operate nicely together. When `tidyverse` is installed it actually is a wrapper that installs the individual packages that make up the tidyverse core.

The tidyverse consists of a core set of packages to perform common tasks in data analysis and are `ggplot2` (plotting), `dplyr` (data manipulation), `tidyr` (data tidying), `readr` (data importing), `purrr` (functional programming), `tibble` (a special type of data frame), `stringr` (common tasks for string manipulations), and  `forcats` (dealing with factors)


```{r install tidyverse, eval = FALSE}
# Download and install the packages of tidyverse
install.packages("tidyverse")
```


```{r}
# load the tidyverse packages for the current session
library(tidyverse)
```

### R for Data science extra packages

If you are following along with R for Data Science make sure you have these packages installed:

- nycflights13
- gapminder
- Lahman

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("nycflights13", "gapminder", "Lahman"))
```
