This module is going to cover: 

- using the {here} package to manage paths for scripts and rmarkdown

- Using the document outline/collapsing code in Rscripts
- (briefly) converting a R script into a notebook

The main focus will be on covering the usefulness of Rmarkdown in creating descriptive analysis documents

Cover the basics of the 3 components of an Rmarkdown document
- yaml
- markdown
- code chunks

Introduce the basic syntax of Markdown
- headers
- bold/italics
- lists
- verbatim code


Options of a code chunk
- echo
- eval
- include
- warning
- message
- fig
- results
- inline code

Embedding images
- images
  - knitr::include_graphics
  - `![]()`
  
Embedding plots


Making tables
- markdown
- knitr::kable
  - customising tables with the {kableExtra} package

## Some more R Markdown

Let's look more closely at how you can use R Markdown to generate well-formatted research reports.

1\. Following the procedure described in Handout 2 - Get Started with R, create an R Markdown file

2\. The new file contains some template text. In the *second shaded block* replace the command `summary(cars)` with some of the code you have just written. Be careful not to delete either of the lines that begin with ```. Those symbols signal to RStudio that the contents is R code, not text. 

For example, I made this replacement:

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "Replace the template code with yours", fig.pos = "H", echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("images/markdown_replace_code.png")
```

3\. You might also want to replace some of the text (in the non-shaded areas), to match your new code. 

4\. Knit the document (click the Knit button). Wait while R processes the document. It will generate output to the console, but you can ignore that for now.

5\. Admire the result.

## Exercise - R Markdown

1. Figure out how to generate a Word document with R Markdown (Hint: look at the dropdown list beside the Knit button, by clicking the small triangle).
2. Some lines in the text areas of the R Markdown template start with ##, and the text is coloured Blue. What does the ## do? What do you think prefacing a line of text with ### would do? Test your theory.
