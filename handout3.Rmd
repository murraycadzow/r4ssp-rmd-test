## Vector subsetting

In the first week we touched on vectors and using the `[]` to extract items out based on an index. We're now going to expand on this idea but for our dataframes.



## Dataframe subsetting {.tabset}

### Base R

- `$`
- `[,]`
  - names
  - index
  - conditional


### dplyr

pipes %>% 

- select
  - starts_with
  - ends_with
  - contains
  - anyof


- filter
- slice





## Plotting

base R and ggplot2

- 
- line plot
